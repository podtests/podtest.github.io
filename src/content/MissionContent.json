  "text": "Our Mentor 'Akhil Jain' is not running this program in partnership with any company, we are reaching directly to aspiring SDET's. Due to this we have more cushion & control on things & can take necessary steps for uplifting our QA/SDET community. Other companies are charging Rs 3,00,000 for half the curriculum of this course. Our expected pricing will be between Rs 20,000- Rs 25,000 only for a 6+ month program.",
